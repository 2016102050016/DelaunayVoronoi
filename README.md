# C# Delaunay triangulation (Bowyer–Watson algorithm)

A C# implementation of the [Bowyer–Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm).
The result is a [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation#Algorithms) for a set of randomly generated points.

## Why C#?

It just looks good. Also, blog posts listed below talking about procedural content and map generation caught my eye.
Since my intention is to port the algorithm to the Unity game engine for future projects, I decided to stick to C#, as it is Unity's scripting language of choice.
